# BOLT Standards

<div class="lightning-intro">

## What does BOLT mean?

<div class="intro-card">

**BOLT** means **"Basis of Lightning Technology"**. It is the set of technical specifications that define how Lightning Network works in a standard and interoperable way.

BOLTs are technical documents that establish the protocols, message formats, and procedures that all Lightning nodes must follow to communicate with each other. Without these standards, each Lightning implementation would be incompatible with the others.

## Complete list of BOLT specifications

<div class="intro-card bolt-spec">

### BOLT 1: Base Protocol

**Description:** Defines the fundamentals of the Lightning protocol, including connection establishment, message types, and the communication format between nodes.

**Purpose:** Establishes the foundation upon which all other BOLT specifications are built.

## Importance of BOLT standards

<div class="intro-card">

BOLT standards are essential for Lightning Network because:

- **Interoperability:** They allow different Lightning implementations (such as LND, Core Lightning, Eclair) to work together.
- **Security:** They establish proven cryptographic and security protocols.
- **Innovation:** They provide a solid foundation upon which to build new functionalities.
- **Adoption:** They facilitate adoption by having clear and documented specifications.

Each BOLT is maintained by the Lightning community and can evolve over time to include new features and security improvements.

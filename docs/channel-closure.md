# Channel Closure in Lightning Network

<div class="lightning-intro">

## Why close a channel?

<div class="intro-card">

After using a payment channel in Lightning Network to perform transactions, you will eventually want to close the channel. Closure involves finalizing the connection between the two participants and returning the corresponding funds to each one on the Bitcoin blockchain.

For example, if Alice and Bob have been using their 1,000,000 sats channel and now Alice has 300,000 sats while Bob has 700,000 sats, when closing the channel, Alice will receive 300,000 sats and Bob will receive 700,000 sats on the main blockchain.

## Types of channel closure

<div class="intro-card">

### **Cooperative Closure**

Both participants jointly agree to close the channel and distribute funds according to the last agreed balance.

**Process:**
- A closure transaction is created that reflects the final balance
- Both sign the transaction
- The transaction is sent to the Bitcoin blockchain

**Advantages:** Fast, efficient, and with lower fees.

### **Unilateral Closure**

One of the participants closes the channel without the other's cooperation, useful if the other party doesn't respond or is disconnected.

**Process:**
- The last signed state of the channel is used
- A closure transaction is created and sent
- There is a security waiting period

**Considerations:** Slower and may have higher fees.

## Cooperative closure in detail

<div class="intro-card">

Cooperative closure is the most efficient and economical way to close a channel. Both participants work together to finalize the channel in an orderly manner.

### Practical example

Alice and Bob decide to cooperatively close their channel. Alice has 300,000 sats and Bob has 700,000 sats. Together they create a closure transaction that sends 300,000 sats to Alice's address and 700,000 sats to Bob's address on the main blockchain.

### Advantages of cooperative closure

- **Fast:** No prolonged waiting periods
- **Economical:** Optimized transaction fees
- **Secure:** Both participants confirm the final balance
- **Simple:** Direct and collaborative process

</div>

## Unilateral closure in detail

<div class="intro-card">

Unilateral closure is necessary when one of the participants cannot or does not want to cooperate in closing the channel. This can happen if the other party is disconnected, doesn't respond, or there are technical problems.

### Unilateral closure process

- **Signed state:** The last channel state that both participants signed previously is used
- **Closure transaction:** A transaction is created that distributes funds according to that state
- **Waiting period:** There is a security period (typically 2016 blocks or ~2 weeks) before funds are available

### Important considerations

- **Time:** The waiting period can delay access to funds
- **Cost:** May involve higher transaction fees
- **Caution:** Requires attention to avoid errors and protect funds

</div>

## Disputed closure and security

<div class="intro-card">

A disputed closure can arise if one party tries to cheat by publishing an old channel state that favors them. Lightning Network has security mechanisms to protect against this.

### Protection mechanisms

- **Dispute period:** If an old state is detected, the affected party has time to dispute the closure (typically 2016 blocks)
- **Watchtowers:** Services that monitor channels and act on your behalf for a small fee
- **Justice transaction:** If fraud can be proven, the honest party can claim the entire channel balance as a penalty

The threat of losing all funds by trying to cheat is enough to deter most dishonest operators.

## Times and costs

<div class="intro-card">

### **Cooperative Closure**

*Time:* Immediate once the transaction is confirmed

*Cost:* Single Bitcoin transaction fee

*Security:* Maximum, both participants confirm

### **Unilateral Closure**

*Time:* 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) waiting period

*Cost:* Transaction fee + possible dispute fee

*Security:* High, with anti-fraud mechanisms
